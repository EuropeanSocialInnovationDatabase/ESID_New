ESID is a comprehensive and authoritative source of information on social innovation projects in Europe and beyond. Initially developed as part of the EU Funded KNOWMAK project, ESID is now being developed as part of the EU funded RISIS 2 Project. ESID utilizes advanced machine learning and natural language processing techniques to collect information about social innovation projects and actors from the publicly available information on the web. ESID also uses some limited human annotation to train its machine learning models and to ensure the quality and the integrity of the data. ESID is developed by a team based at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK.
